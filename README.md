In this project, you will learn to create the  calculator with the built-in java awt/swing graphics library.

Throughout the project, you will learn how to create a gui (graphical user interface) for the calculator, style the buttons to resemble the  calculator, add numbers to a display, and evaluate different  mathematical expressions through button clicks.


## Further Implementation:
We can continue working on this project like implement the missing click handler for the squareroot button. In addition we can expand the number of buttons to include scientific calculations with sin, cos, tan, log, etc. We can also add a delete button to remove a digit at a time as opposed to clear all, and other functions such as absolute value, power, remainder, etc.
