In this project, you will learn to create the  calculator with the built-in java awt/swing graphics library.Throughout the project, you will learn how to create a gui (graphical user interface) for the calculator, style the buttons to resemble the  calculator, add numbers to a display, and evaluate different  mathematical expressions through button clicks.
## Further Implementation:
We can continue working on this project like implement the missing click handler for the squareroot button. In addition we can expand the number of buttons to include scientific calculations with sin, cos, tan, log, etc. We can also add a delete button to remove a digit at a time as opposed to clear all, and other functions such as absolute value, power, remainder, etc.

About the Project
The Calculator Application is a simple yet functional Java-based program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Designed with efficiency and ease of use in mind, this project demonstrates core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), user input handling, and exception management.

Features:
✔️ Perform basic mathematical operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division).
✔️ User-friendly console-based interface.
✔️ Handles invalid inputs and division by zero errors.
✔️ Modular structure following Object-Oriented Programming principles.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
Concepts Applied: OOP, Exception Handling, Methods, and User Input Handling
Use Cases:
A beginner-friendly project for learning Java.
A foundation for expanding into a GUI-based or scientific calculator.
